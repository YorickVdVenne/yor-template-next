## Git Workflow Conventions

### Branch Naming
- `feature/*`: For new features.
- `bugfix/*`: For bug fixes.
- `hotfix/*`: For urgent fixes.
- `chore/*`: For minor changes like refactoring and updating dependencies.
- `docs/*`: For documentation updates.

### Commit Message Format
We follow the **Conventional Commits** standard:
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
- **Type** can be one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
- **Scope** is optional, representing the affected part of the codebase (e.g., `auth`, `api`).
- Example: `feat(auth): add user login`

Commit messages and branch names are checked before pushing changes.
